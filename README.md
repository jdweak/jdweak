Currently a junior at UCSD studying computer science. I love programming and exploring all of the fields and applications of it. Fields of computer science I'm interested in include cyber security, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. I have worked as an engineering intern involved in the manufacturing of sonar arrays, as a software engineering and fullstack SWE intern at a cybersecurity startup, and as an undergraduate researcher in NLP. In my free time I have done various personal projects like Minecraft plugins, Android app development, and programming competitions/hackathons.
