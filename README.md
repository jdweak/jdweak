Currently a freshman at UCSD studying computer science. I love programming and exploring all of the fields and applications of it, having done Minecraft plugins, Android app development, and some web delevopment (through a hackathon) in my free time. Fields of computer science I'm interested in include cyber security, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. I have previously worked as an engineering intern at Sonatech llc where I ran quality assurance tests on sonar arrays the company built and wrote MATLAB scripts to help with data analysis and testing. I plan to keep doing internships during the Summers during college, and I'm also currently applying for research programs at UCSD for next year.
